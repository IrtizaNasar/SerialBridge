Bridge software, which includes the desktop application, associated documentation,
example code, and any updates or supplements provided by the Licensor
(collectively, the "Software").

By downloading, installing, copying, or otherwise using the Software, You agree
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If You do not agree, do not download,
install, or use the Software.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. DEFINITIONS

   1.1 "Individual" means a natural person acting in their personal capacity, and
       not on behalf of, or at the direction of, any Organisation.

   1.2 "Organisation" means any corporation, company, partnership, institution,
       association, government body, educational establishment, school, college,
       university, academy, training provider, coding bootcamp, research
       institute, or any other entity, whether for-profit or non-profit, that
       employs, contracts, enrols, instructs, or otherwise engages two or more
       persons.

   1.3 "Institutional Use" means any use of the Software that is:
       (a) directed, required, recommended, suggested, or facilitated by an
           Organisation in connection with its operations, curricula, courses,
           workshops, programmes, research, or activities; or
       (b) use by any person (including but not limited to students, employees,
           contractors, faculty, researchers, or volunteers) where such use is
           related to, associated with, or for the benefit of an Organisation; or
       (c) installation or use on hardware owned, leased, or controlled by an
           Organisation; or
       (d) use that is funded, subsidised, or reimbursed by an Organisation.

       For the avoidance of doubt, Institutional Use includes but is not limited
       to the following scenarios:
       - A university lecturer includes Serial Bridge in a course syllabus.
       - A school instructs students to download and use the Software as part of
         a class, workshop, or assignment.
       - Students use the Software on personal devices for coursework,
         assignments, or projects set by an educational institution.
       - A coding bootcamp or training provider uses the Software in its
         curriculum or teaching materials.
       - A company uses the Software for internal tooling, prototyping, or
         product development.
       - A research institute uses the Software in any research project.
       - An Organisation provides the Software to employees, contractors, or
         members for any purpose.

   1.4 "Individual Use" means use of the Software by an Individual for personal
       projects, self-directed learning, hobbyist activities, or non-commercial
       creative work, where such use is NOT Institutional Use as defined in
       Section 1.3.

   1.5 "Commercial Licence" means a paid licence obtained from the Licensor that
       grants an Organisation the right to engage in Institutional Use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. GRANT OF LICENCE

   2.1 Individual Use Licence (Free)
       Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Licensor grants You a
       non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, worldwide
       licence to download, install, and use the Software free of charge solely
       for Individual Use.

   2.2 Institutional Use Licence (Paid)
       Any Institutional Use requires a valid Commercial Licence. Organisations
       must contact the Licensor to obtain a Commercial Licence before any
       Institutional Use commences.

       An Organisation may NOT circumvent this requirement by:
       (a) instructing, encouraging, or permitting individuals to download the
           Software on their own personal devices or accounts;
       (b) framing Institutional Use as "optional" or "recommended" rather than
           "required";
       (c) providing indirect access to the Software through any intermediary;
       (d) claiming that because individuals downloaded the Software independently,
           no Commercial Licence is needed; or
       (e) any other means designed to avoid the Commercial Licence requirement.

   2.3 Evaluation Period
       Organisations may evaluate the Software for a period of thirty (30)
       calendar days from first installation without a Commercial Licence, solely
       for the purpose of assessing whether to purchase a Commercial Licence.
       Continued use beyond this period constitutes a breach of this Agreement.
